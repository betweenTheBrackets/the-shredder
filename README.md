# The Shredder: An Amusingly Absurdly Indispensable Post-Processor for TypeScript

![The Shredder](//the_shredder.png)

Because who needs comments anyway, right? They are just clutter, notes for the weak. You, my friend, are a coding Spartan. Your code is so transparent, so self-explanatory, that even a toddler who has just discovered the joys of gnawing on the mouse cord could understand it. You just vomit out self-documenting code. Who cares about future you? Or any other developer who might dare to delve into your flawless logic? Nah, comments are for chumps.

Welcome to The Shredder. The digital equivalent of tearing up your high school report card, or that love letter you never had the courage to send. But, in this case, we're massacring your TypeScript comments. Because who cares about good practice when you can bask in the chaos, right?

## Getting Started

If you're reading this, you're probably in one of two categories:

1. Someone who thinks this is a good idea (You probably also like pineapple on pizza, you monster)
2. Someone who is just here for a laugh. 

Either way, buckle up. It's going to be a wild ride.

## Installation

The Shredder is distributed as a npm package. Install it using the following command, and please try not to cry while doing it:

```bash
npm install the-shredder
```

Now you can use it as a command line tool, or as part of your overly complicated build script.

## Usage

Run the shredder on your `.ts` files like a hot knife through butter:

```bash
npx the-shredder ./your-path/*.ts
```

And watch the massacre ensue, as every single comment in your TypeScript files gets mercilessly obliterated. Sayonara, useful context! Adios, explanations! Toodles, code author info!

## Documentation

Hah, just kidding! We shredded it. Remember?

## Contributing

Nope. We don't want your comments.

## Bugs and Issues

Find a bug? Good for you. Keep it to yourself. Remember, we don't want your comments.

## License

This software is provided as-is. Seriously, don't blame us if this causes any problems. We're just here to shred your comments.

In conclusion, The Shredder is here for the developers who dare to tread where angels fear to step. Because clearly, comments are for the weak. 

Keep shredding, you majestic coding creature.
